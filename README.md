## Installation

### HACS (recommended)
1. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS
2. Install "Lynk & Co"
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to Settings → Integrations → Add → Lynk & Co

### Manual
Copy `custom_components/lynkco/` to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.

## Setup

The integration uses Azure AD B2C authentication with MFA. Setup requires a one-time browser login:

1. Add the integration in Home Assistant
2. A login URL is generated — open it in your browser
3. Log in with your Lynk & Co email + password + SMS MFA code
4. After MFA, the browser will fail to open `msauth://...`
5. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab → find the 302 request → copy the `Location` header value
6. Paste the full `msauth://...` URL back in Home Assistant

Tokens are automatically refreshed. You should only need to re-authenticate if the refresh token expires.

## Polling

Vehicle data is polled every 15 minutes by default.

## Supported Models

Tested with the 2025 platform used by:
- Lynk & Co 01 (PHEV)
- Lynk & Co 02 (BEV)
- Lynk & Co 08

> **Note**: Pre-2025 Lynk & Co 01 models use a different platform and are NOT supported.
