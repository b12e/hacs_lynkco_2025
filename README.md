# Lynk & Co Home Assistant Integration

Custom [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration for 2025 Lynk & Co vehicles (01, 02, 08) via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

This HACS plugin was vibe-coded by decompiling the Lynk&Co Android app and letting Claude Code have a run at the code to figure out endpoints and authentication. Claude then wrote the python - although I'm not a stranger to python, it was just easier this way :) 

It should work for the European Lynk&Co vehicles on the new platform (facelift 01, 02, 08). I've tested myself with the 2025 Lynk&Co 01.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)
1. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS
2. Install "Lynk & Co"
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to Settings → Integrations → Add → Lynk & Co

### Manual
Copy `custom_components/lynkco/` to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.

## Setup

The integration uses Azure AD B2C authentication with MFA. Setup requires a one-time browser login:

1. Add the integration in Home Assistant
2. A login URL is generated - open it in your browser
3. Log in with your Lynk & Co email + password + SMS MFA code
4. After MFA, the browser will fail to open `msauth://...`
5. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab → find the last request → copy the `Location` header value (note: Firefox dev tools don't show the entire header. Right click on the request and copy the response headers instead, and then get the `msauth://` header from there)
6. Paste the full `msauth://...` URL back in Home Assistant

This process should be similar to the HACS integration for pre-2025 Lynk&Co cars such as the [Donkie](https://github.com/Donkie/Hass-Lynk-Co) one. 

Tokens are automatically refreshed. You should only need to re-authenticate if the refresh token expires.

## Polling

Vehicle data is polled every 15 minutes by default. If you want to poll more frequently, you can do so using Home Assistant automations by calling the update action, although I don't recommend to update more often 24/7. 

Data is also refreshed by default after any other action is called.

## Supported Models

Tested with the 2025 platform used by:
- Lynk & Co 01 (PHEV) - confirmed working
- Lynk & Co 02 (BEV) - not tested
- Lynk & Co 08 (PHEV) - not tested

> **Note**: Pre-2025 Lynk & Co 01 models use a different platform and are NOT supported. You can try your luck with [this](https://github.com/Donkie/Hass-Lynk-Co) repo.
