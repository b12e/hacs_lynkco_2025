# Lynk & Co Home Assistant Integration

Custom [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration for 2025 Lynk & Co vehicles (01, 02, 08) via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

This HACS plugin was vibe-coded by decompiling the Lynk&Co Android app and letting Claude Code have a run at the code to figure out endpoints and authentication. Claude then wrote the python - although I'm not a stranger to python, it was just easier this way :) 

It works for the European Lynk&Co vehicles on the new platform (2025 and newer). I've tested myself with the 2025 Lynk&Co 01 and have had confirmation it works for the Lynk&Co 02 BEV and Lynk&Co 08 PHEV.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)
1. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS
2. Install "Lynk & Co"
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to Settings → Integrations → Add → Lynk & Co

### Manual
Copy `custom_components/lynkco/` to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.

## Setup

The integration uses Azure AD B2C authentication with MFA. Setup requires a one-time browser login:

1. Add the integration in Home Assistant
2. A login URL is generated - open it in your browser
3. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab
4. Log in with your Lynk & Co email + password + SMS MFA code
5. After MFA, the browser will fail to open `msauth://...`
6. In the network tab of your developer tools, find the last request → copy the `Location` header value (note: Firefox dev tools don't show the entire header. Right click on the request and copy the response headers instead, and then get the `msauth://` header from there)
7. Paste the full `msauth://...` URL back in Home Assistant

This process should be similar to the HACS integration for pre-2025 Lynk&Co cars such as the [Donkie](https://github.com/Donkie/Hass-Lynk-Co) one. 

Tokens are automatically refreshed. You should only need to re-authenticate if the refresh token expires.

## Polling

Vehicle data is polled every 15 minutes by default. If you want to poll more frequently, you can do so using Home Assistant automations by calling the update action, although I don't recommend to update more often 24/7. 

Data is also refreshed by default after any other action is called.

## Supported Models

Tested on the following vehicles:
- 2025 (New) Lynk & Co 01 (PHEV)
- 2025 Lynk & Co 02 (BEV)
- 2025 Lynk & Co 08 (PHEV)

Other models are currently not available on the EU market, although it is likely when they do become available they are on the same platform and will work. The documentation will be updated accordingly as soon as this happens.

> **Note**: Pre-2025 Lynk & Co 01 models use a different platform and are NOT supported. You can try your luck with [this](https://github.com/Donkie/Hass-Lynk-Co) repo.
